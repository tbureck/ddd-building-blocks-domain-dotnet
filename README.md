# DDD Building Blocks: Domain

DDD Building Blocks is a collection of projects targeted at developers to provide simple yet powerful tools to quickly bootstrap an application using tactical Domain Driven Design patterns.

The Domain project contains basic objects to reflect the domain layer of your application. They are supposed to make creating classes like entities, repositories, aggregates or domain events easier. Head over to the documentation to get know more.

In order to get started with your application simply add this library to your project as a NuGet dependency:

```
dotnet add package TBureck.BuildingBlocks.Domain
